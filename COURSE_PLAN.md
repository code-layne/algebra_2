# Algebra 2 — Course Scope & Sequence

**Course:** Algebra 2: Shepherd · **School year:** 2026–2027

> **Status:** Draft v1. Unit 1 is built in source. **Unit 2 is fully scaffolded**
> (lessons 2.0–2.5, all components + keys as skeletons, plus unit tests). **Lessons 2.0, 2.1, and
> 2.2 are now fully authored and build** (each: plan, cover, warm-up, notes, activity, exit ticket,
> homework, all keys, and a 7-slide deck; `make -C unit02/lessonNN all` → EXIT 0). Lessons
> 2.3–2.5 remain skeletons. Units 3–8 are planned here and not yet scaffolded. Lesson lists
> below are proposals to react to and edit — pacing (days per lesson) is
> intentionally left open pending the school calendar.

## 1. Design principles

- **Function-type organization.** After a foundations unit, each unit is built
  around one function family (linear → quadratic → polynomial → rational →
  radical → exponential → logarithmic).
- **Lesson 0 = "Characteristics of ____ Functions."** Every unit opens with a
  Lesson 0 that studies the *behavior* of the new function type before students
  learn to manipulate/solve it.
- **Cumulative characteristics spine.** Each Lesson 0 re-teaches the full
  "read-a-graph" toolkit built so far, then **adds the new characteristics that
  this function type is the first to require** (e.g., asymptotes debut in Unit 5,
  origin symmetry in Unit 4). See §3 for the full progression.
- **Consistent component set per lesson.** warm-up, notes/slides, activity,
  exit ticket, homework, cover — each with an answer key (matches Unit 1).

## 2. Units at a glance

| Unit | Title | Function family | Lessons (incl. L0) | Status |
|:---:|---|---|:---:|---|
| 1 | Foundations | (review) | 3 (no L0) | **Built** |
| 2 | Linear Functions | Linear, absolute value, piecewise | 6 | **Scaffolded** |
| 3 | Quadratic Functions | Quadratic (incl. complex numbers) | ~7 | Planned |
| 4 | Polynomial Functions | Polynomial | ~6 | Planned |
| 5 | Rational Functions | Rational | ~6 | Planned |
| 6 | Radical Functions | Radical / power | ~5 | Planned |
| 7 | Exponential Functions | Exponential | ~5 | Planned |
| 8 | Logarithmic Functions | Logarithmic | ~5 | Planned |

Units 2–8 each open with **Lesson X.0: Characteristics of ____ Functions**.
**Out of scope for this course:** conic sections, sequences & series, probability
& statistics, trigonometry, and linear systems / linear programming.

## 3. The characteristics-of-functions spine (the heart of the course)

Each unit's Lesson 0 revisits everything to its left and introduces the row(s)
marked ●. Legend: **● introduced here** · **○ revisited / deepened** ·
**· applied but not new**.

| Characteristic | U1 | U2 Lin | U3 Quad | U4 Poly | U5 Rat'l | U6 Rad | U7 Exp | U8 Log |
|---|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| Function definition & notation | ● | · | · | · | · | · | · | · |
| Domain & range (from a graph) | ● | ○ | ○ | ○ | ○ | ○ | ○ | ○ |
| x- and y-intercepts / zeros | | ● | ○ | ○ | ○ | ○ | ○ | ○ |
| Slope / constant rate of change | | ● | | | | | | |
| Increasing / decreasing intervals | | ● | ○ | ○ | ○ | ○ | ○ | ○ |
| Positive / negative intervals | | ● | ○ | ○ | ○ | ○ | ○ | ○ |
| Maximum / minimum (extrema) | | | ● | ○ | · | · | · | · |

| Relative vs. absolute extrema | | | | ● | · | · | · | · |
| Turning points | | | | ● | · | | | |
| Zero multiplicity (graph behavior) | | | | ● | · | | | |
| **Asymptotes (vertical)** | | | | | ● | | | ○ |

| Inverse relationship of families | | | | | | ● | | ○ |
| Growth vs. decay / constant ratio | | | | | | | ● | · |
| Inverse of exponential (dom/range swap) | | | | | | | | ● |

> This table is the pacing/coherence backbone. When authoring each Lesson 0, the
> "new" rows (●) are the teaching focus; the "○/·" rows are quick review applied
> to the new graph.
>
> **Preview note:** the absolute-value and piecewise lessons in Unit 2 give
> students an early, informal look at **vertex, axis of symmetry, and min/max**
> (the V-shape) before Unit 3 formalizes them for parabolas. The ● stays in U3
> because that's where the Lesson-0 progression makes them a teaching focus.

## 5. Assessment structure

Per Unit 1's pattern:
- **Per lesson:** warm-up, exit ticket, homework (each with key).
- **Per unit:** unit cover + sample test + sample test key.
- **Course-level reference exists** in `spec/`: mid-year test and final exam
  (All Things Algebra originals) — usable as models, not for redistribution.

*(Open: mid-year checkpoint placement — natural break after Unit 4.)*

---

## 6. Decisions & remaining open questions

**Resolved:**
- Absolute-value & piecewise functions → **Unit 2**.
- Complex numbers → **Unit 3** (with quadratics); quadratic systems → **Unit 3**.
- Advanced factoring (sum/difference of cubes, two-variable expressions) → **Unit 4**.
- Conic sections, sequences & series, probability & statistics, trigonometry →
  **out of scope** (no material taught).
- Systems of **linear** equations/inequalities & linear programming →
  **out of scope** (omitted). *(Systems of **quadratics** remain in Unit 3.)*

**Still open:**
- **Pacing:** days per lesson / target unit lengths, and how they fit the calendar.

---

## 7. Conventions

- **Directory:** `unitXX/lessonYY/` with the standard component subfolders
  (`warmup`, `notes`/`slides`, `activity`, `exit_ticket`, `homework`, `cover`,
  plus each `*_key`). Unit-level: `unit_cover`, `sample_test`, `sample_test_key`.
- **Lesson 0 numbering:** the characteristics lesson is `lesson00` in each unit
  (or `X.0` in titles) so content lessons keep 1-based numbers.
- **Build:** `make -C unitXX all`; root `make all` / `make student` / `make full`.
- **Authoring:** use the `lesson-planning` skill.
